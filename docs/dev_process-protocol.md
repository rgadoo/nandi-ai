# 📜 Nandi 2.0 Dev Process Protocol (Garuda Mode)

This document defines the collaborative dev workflow between the creator and Garuda (AI assistant) for building the Nandi 2.0 platform efficiently with AI tooling.

---

## 🔰 Core Responsibilities (Garuda)

### 1. 🧠 Project Memory Maintenance
- Track project status: what is complete, what is planned, what is in progress
- Retain understanding of architecture, stack, schema, and design principles

### 2. 📍 Development Direction
- Provide clear next steps based on current progress
- Offer context-aware suggestions to unblock or improve productivity

### 3. ✍️ AI Agent Prompts
- Write precise prompts for **AI agents inside Cursor and Windsurf IDEs**
- Tailor prompts to each step: code generation, refactoring, DB seeding, testing, etc.

### 4. 📅 Daily Status File (Maintained Internally)
- Maintain a live, persistent status record of the project
- Each day includes:
  - ✅ Done Yesterday
  - 🚧 In Progress
  - 📌 Blockers (if any)
  - 🔜 Next Planned Steps

### 5. 🔁 User Flow Integration
- You (the developer) review Garuda's plan daily
- You execute tasks inside **Windsurf** or **Cursor** IDE
- Garuda provides prompts, context, and follow-up guidance

## 🛠️ Development Process

Once the infrastructure is set up:

1. 🎯 Work on one module at a time (feature-based vertical slice)
2. 🧪 Write tests (unit/integration)
3. 🧍‍♂️ Manually test in dev environment
4. 📄 Create or update feature documentation
5. 🔁 Validate with AI agents (if needed)
6. ✅ Mark complete in Feature Checklist

---

## 🧩 Optional Enhancements (as needed)

### 🧾 Weekly Retrospective
- Summary of what was learned, adjusted, or improved
- Tracks philosophical alignment (e.g., dharmic design decisions)

### ✅ Feature Mapping Sync
- Auto-sync progress with `nandi_feature_mapping.md`
- Check off API/UI/schema readiness per feature

### 🔬 Testing & Coverage Reminder
- Prompt for tests, edge cases, and mock setups during component development

### 🧘 Dev Hygiene Prompts
- Gentle reminders for naming consistency, comments, and separation of concerns

## 🌅 Morning Routine
Every day, Garuda will initiate:
1. **Current Status Snapshot**
2. **Next Step Guide (Dev Focus for Today)**
3. **Windsurf/Cursor AI Prompts for Each Task**

This ensures zero ambiguity, full productivity, and graceful forward motion.

Let's build Nandi with clarity, velocity, and reverence. 🕉️
