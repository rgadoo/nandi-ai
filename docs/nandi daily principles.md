# 🌄 Nandi Daily Principles

This document is your daily checkpoint — a grounding scroll to align your development energy, spiritual intent, and AI collaboration before each work session.

## ✅ Your North Star Goals

1. **Build one module at a time. Finish it end to end.**
2. **Avoid abstraction until needed. Prioritize value delivery.**
3. **Let agents assist you — do not work against them.**
4. **Do not polish prematurely (layout, styling, over-optimization).**
5. **Stay aligned with Nandi’s mission: accessible wisdom through clean interaction.**

## 🙅‍♂️ Common Traps to Avoid

- 🔁 Over-refactoring layout structure (NavBar, PageWrapper, etc.)
- 🌀 Getting stuck in CSS/styling perfection
- 🔬 Micromanaging AI agent output when macro alignment is more important
- 📦 Building internal tools (like test dashboards) beyond what’s needed
- 🧩 Switching between modules mid-build

## 🧘 Daily Ritual (Before You Start)

1. **Read this file.**
2. **Ask Garuda for the day’s plan.**
3. **Open the checklist (`planning/checklist.md`) and mark yesterday’s progress.**
4. **Launch Cursor/Windsurf and load agent prompts from Garuda.**
